** 5. Longest Palindromic Substring
Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume
that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example:
*Input*: "babad"
*Output*: "bab"
*Note*: "aba" is also a valid answer.

*Approach 1*
Brute force
Produce all possible substrings O(n^2)
Check if Palindrome O(n)

Overall complexity: O(n^3)
